# CS-255-Portfolio

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass, the client, wanted a website where users could take trainings, practice tests, and sign up for in person training for drivers ed. It had to be a website, and it had to be compatible with many different platforms.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
I think I managed to collect a lot of the requirements. I don't think my diagrams included eveyrthing, but they were as clean and readable as I could manage to make them.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If this was something that I intended to implement, I would include database design, and think more seriously about how my code would interact with the database. The project didn't allow for as much database design as I would have liked.

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure to translate all of the needs from the DriverPass interview into requirements. If the user's needs aren't addressed while designing, you won't design the correct app. When designing something that will be used, it is very necessary to ensure that its use goes as smoothly as possible.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think it's important to collect all of the client's needs, and start with the barebones of the system before moving out. If I am designing the system to be implemented in an Agile way, the first things that would need to be completed should be prioritized.
